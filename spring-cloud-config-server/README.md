We need spring-cloud-config-server to manage configuration of different services.
  
C: In microservice, multiple service configuration needs to be maintained. It would be tedious to maintain
   configuration of each microservice in different place.

S: Spring-cloud-config-server provides an approach to store all the configuration of all the environment
   of all the microservice in Git repository. Help us to keep configuration in one place which makes it
   easy to maintain the configuration for all microservices.
